# About the Data
The MNIST dataset is a widely used collection of handwritten digits, commonly employed for training and testing image classification systems. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, with each image being a 28x28 grayscale representation of a handwritten digit (0-9). The dataset is considered a standard benchmark for evaluating and comparing image classification algorithms. 
# Content:
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, from 0 to 9.
# Size:
Each image is 28 pixels by 28 pixels, resulting in a total of 784 pixels (28 * 28) per image. 
# Color:
The images are grayscale, meaning they have pixel values representing shades of gray. 
# Training and Testing Sets:
The dataset is typically divided into a training set of 60,000 images and a testing set of 10,000 images. 
# Purpose:
MNIST serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms, particularly those used for image classification. 
# Accessibility:
The dataset is readily available for download and use, through libraries like Keras. 
# Preprocessing:
The original MNIST data was preprocessed by normalizing the size of the handwritten digits and centering them within the 28x28 image frame. This standardization makes it easier for machine learning models to learn from the data.
